Description: Aggregates multiple BGC runs, plots LnL traces, and associates 
    GFF annotations with genomic scaffolds that were also run through BGC.
    Then, it makes the Hybrid Index X Phi plots from Gompert et al. (2012),
    and plots trascriptome and scaffold loci onto ideograms. The INTROGRESS
    functions run INTROGRESS genomic clines then associate environmental
    raster layers with the INTROGRESS genomic clines. MAXENT is run on
    a folder of raster layers (e.g., the 19 BIOCLIM layers) and sample
    localities to determine the most important layers, and genomic
    cline X environment plots are generated using the most important layers.
